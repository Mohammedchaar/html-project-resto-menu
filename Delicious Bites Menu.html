  <strong>Fettuccine Alfredo </strong>This fettuccini is served with a homemade sauce that doesn't take much more time than opening a jar. Once you see how easy and delicious it is to make it from scratch, you'll never reach for store-bought again.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Honey-Garlic Chicken </strong>Honey and garlic are always a dynamic duo, especially when used to create a flavor-packed sauce for chicken thighs. We like serving this main dish over mashed potatoes with Bacon-Balsamic Brussels Sprouts on the side.
        </li>
       <li>
          <strong> Steak Diane</strong>This retro dinner starts with beef tenderloin filets. Though this cut of meat is a little more expensive, we recommend it for this elegant dinner.
